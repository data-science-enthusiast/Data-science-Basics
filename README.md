Generate   100   3-dimensional   vectors   that   come   from   a   normal   distribution   with   mean vector   as   [1   2   1]t   and   3x3   covariance   matrix   as  
[4   0.8   -0.3;   0.8   2   0.6;   -0.3   0.6   5]
Make   scatter   plots   of   x1   vs   x2,   x1   vs   x3,   and   x2   vs   x3.   Explain   whatever   relationships   you can   gather   from   these   plots   :
